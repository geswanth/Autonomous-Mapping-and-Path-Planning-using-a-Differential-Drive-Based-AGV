# Autonomous-Mapping-and-Path-Planning-using-a-Differential-Drive-Based-AGV
Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) is a mobile robot which moves along a prescribed path. It is one of key equipments in modern industrial automation logistics systems and flexible production systems like Computer integrated manufacturing system. It is widely used in food ,Manufacturing and Pharmaceutical industries . In this project we are going to design a two wheeled differential drive based mobile robot (AGV) which tracks its trajectory following a guide tape which also maps the entire shop floor autonomously and plans the shortest path between two prescribed nodes along with traffic control like collision avoidance. To track the tape PID control system is implemented and UART based wireless communication system of range 300ft is also used for interfacing the robot with computer. An optimised Flood Fill algorithm is used to map the shop floor and stored in the form of adjacent matrix type format of graph data structure and on given commands the robot plans the shortest path using dijkstra algorithm.
